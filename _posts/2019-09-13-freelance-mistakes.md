1st mistake

I learn programming at school but it gave me bad habits.When you are learning for exams on paper, you are trying to memorise as much as possible because there is no google at the exam...
And you will often start work from the start. When you can have already done that work before and needed to copy paste to gain a lot of time.
You have to understand to use the tools at your disposal to do the work including google.And even if you are not stuck its better to use google search to have a huge speed boost.

2nd mistake
My 1st client wasn't ready to put the price, and it put the burden on me to make it work.And tried to work fast.I did it anyway for €1/h for 2 months.
It was a valuable learning experience but that might have been too much.

3rd mistake

I felt I wasn't good enough... That I had to compensate with more of my time and effort.
So I did something close to 18-20h/day work.
No matter what, I think 10h a day is most I can give even if I am bad at something.

4th mistake

Even if I am during a freelance mission, I still need to do things I normally do like going to sport one to two times a week, take some fresh air outside.
This will allow me to not burnout again and still take a liking into the work I do.

5th mistake

Make it clear your ability to yourself and your client if you can succeed the mission.
The extra tip is to use software that boost your speed and/or the quality of your work. Since it was a programming freelance mission mine was about the ability to go back to what worked at a previous save

resume:

1st mistake I was in "learning mode/exam mode" instead of being in "doing the best/fastest job" I can using any resource I have including google.

2nd mistake price (€1/h)

3rd Time Management(20h-18h/day work)

4th Energy Management(burnout)

5th know the Limits on your ability(promised way too much for that)/ time wise.

extra tip: Use Github/Git or other Version Control software.
