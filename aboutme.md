Hi, my name is Fred.
I learned to code at university and in websites like openclassrooms.
Since I am passionate about technologies like bitcoin, blockchain, artificial inteligence, more broadly computer science; I am keeping my knowledge up to date with the latest changes and I am eager to see how those technologies are going applied to create new solutions.
