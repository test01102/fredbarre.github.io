Hi, my name is Fred.

I learned computer science at university and in websites like openclassrooms.
Since I am passionate about technologies like bitcoin, blockchain, artificial intelligence, more broadly computer science; I am maintaining my knowledge up to date with the latest changes and I am eager to see how those new technologies are going to create alternatives solutions.

I am transitionning into freelance writing to share my knowledge and passion.
